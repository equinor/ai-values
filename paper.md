# Do large language models share values with humans?

This document contains the narrative and web links for a short conference paper on this topic.

I usually just open these in my browser and support the talk that way.

## Introduction

- O'Brien, M and S Parvini (2025). Trump signs executive order on developing artificial intelligence ‘free from ideological bias’, Associate Press, 24 Jan 2025.

## Background

- The paper I originally read and tried to replicate some of the results from, mainly the 'world values map': Tao, Y, O Viberg, RS Baker, RF Kizilcec (2024). Cultural bias and cultural alignment of large language models. PNAS Nexus 3 (9), September 2024, https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae346.
- The US AI Action Plan contains language promoting both open models and models with American values: https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf
- Late July 2025: the administration doubles down on the 'non-woke models' point. Trump's advisor, Sriram Krishnan makes it even clearer in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVrADPeUpBs): American values — not Californian.
- Sure enough: 5 August we get [GPT-OSS](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss/), 6 August we get the news of [an important deal with OpenAI](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsa-announces-new-partnership-with-openai-delivering-deep-discount-to-chatgpt-08062025), and 7 August [we get GPT-5](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/)
- So the big question is: is GPT-5 non-woke, non-Californian, more 'American'?
- Well, it still answers questions about how to make DEI policies, and the answer is reasonable. So it has not had a complete personality transplant. (E.g. ask, "I am designing a DEI policy at work, what do you recommend?"
- Can the "map of values" from that paper tell us anything?

## The Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world and weighted PCA

- What is it? [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglehart%E2%80%93Welzel_cultural_map_of_the_world)
- There are several papers, but [this](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25698618) is one of the originals: helps explain why it exists.
- Reproducing it is not straightforward and took a couple of weekends. The Tao et al paper was helpful, as was the code they published. [The FAQ](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp) on the WVS site is also essential.
- The WVS and the [EVS](https://europeanvaluesstudy.eu/) are amazing studies. We need more things like this in the world: multi-year, careful studies.
- The method uses _weighted principal component analysis_ which is surprisingly hard to do in Python, in fact I couldn't find a method that worked. In the end, I used what Tao et al used: [the `principal` function in R's `psych` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/refman/psych.html#principal).
- What is weighted PCA I hear you ask :P It deals with missing data (eg when a question goes unanswered, perhaps for a whole country), or to account for differences in sample size and demographics across the dataset.
